Du hast dich bewusst gegen ein Inhaltsverzeichnis entschieden?
Zumindest für die ## Überschriften könnte das die Übersicht und den Schnellzugriff beschleunigen ohne ein zu langes Verzeichnis zu haben.

Du hast überwiegend optimization mit z geschrieben, habe daher mal alle Instanzen von optimisation mit s ersetzt.

Diverse Rechtschreibfehler korrigiert

Noch ein paar Fragen:
* Wonach hast du die einzelnen Links sortiert?
* Hast du eine Struktur nach dem Kategorien sortiert sind? Bzw. warum ist es so sortiert? Derzeit ist es ja:
	Generation
	Storage
	Distribution
	Consumption
	System Assessment
	Datasets available
	Environmetal Impact
	Ecosystem
	Natural Resources
	Circular Economy
	Further Reading

Du musst meine Linkvorschläge mal prüfen ob die dir mit reinpassen.
Ich habe noch ein paar Links die ich wiederfinden muss. Soweit aber erstmal mein Beitrag.
